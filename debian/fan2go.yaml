# Sensor configurations
sensors:
  # Example: CPU Temperature (hwmon)
  # - id: cpu_temp
  #   type: hwmon
  #   params:
  #     # Use 'fan2go detect' to find the correct platform and sensor label/name
  #     platform: "coretemp-isa-0000" # Example, replace with your actual platform
  #     name: "Package id 0"          # Example, replace with your actual sensor name/label
  #     # Or use path directly if known and stable:
  #     # path: "/sys/class/hwmon/hwmonX/tempY_input"

  # Example: GPU Temperature (nvidia) - requires NVML support compiled in
  # - id: gpu_temp
  #   type: nvidia
  #   params:
  #     gpuUUID: "GPU-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx" # Replace with your GPU's UUID

# Fan configurations
fans:
  # Example: CPU Fan (hwmon)
  # - id: cpu_fan
  #   type: hwmon
  #   params:
  #     # Use 'fan2go detect' to find the correct platform and pwm path/label
  #     platform: "coretemp-isa-0000" # Example, must match a sensor's platform for auto-association or be specific
  #     path: "/sys/class/hwmon/hwmonX/pwmY" # Example, replace with your actual PWM control path
  #     # Optional: if you want to read fan speed
  #     # rpmPath: "/sys/class/hwmon/hwmonX/fanY_input"

# Curve definitions (linking sensors to fans)
curves:
  # Example: Control cpu_fan based on cpu_temp
  # - fanId: cpu_fan
  #   sensorId: cpu_temp
  #   # Linear curve: [[temp1, speed1], [temp2, speed2], ...]
  #   # Speeds are in percent (0-100)
  #   linear:
  #     points:
  #       - [30, 20]  # At 30C, fan at 20%
  #       - [50, 40]  # At 50C, fan at 40%
  #       - [70, 80]  # At 70C, fan at 80%
  #       - [80, 100] # At 80C, fan at 100%
  #   # Optional: Minimum fan speed for this curve
  #   minSpeed: 20
  #   # Optional: Maximum fan speed for this curve
  #   maxSpeed: 100
