Description: Fan control daemon based on lm-sensors
 fan2go is a utility to control system fans based on temperature readings
 from lm-sensors. It provides configurable fan curves and runs as a
 systemd service.
 .
 This package provides:
  * The fan2go daemon binary.
  * A default configuration file at /etc/fan2go/fan2go.yaml, pre-configured
    to use /var/lib/fan2go/fan2go.db for its database.
  * A systemd service unit (fan2go.service) for managing the daemon.
